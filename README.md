## Improvements Over Original Version

* Fixed critical bugs in the IPA installation process
* Streamlined the user interface for more intuitive operation
* Enhanced certificate management capabilities
* Improved stability during app signing and installation
* Optimized performance for faster processing
* More reliable AltStore repository integration

## Core Features

Feather allows you to use an Apple Developer Account to sign and install applications on iOS devices without requiring a computer, while providing easy management of your applications. Due to iOS limitations, tracking installed applications can be challenging, so users should maintain awareness of what's installed on their devices. This is a stock application that leverages built-in iOS features!

* AltStore repository support
* Import your own `.ipa` files
* Inject tweaks when signing apps
* Install applications seamlessly over-the-air
* Multiple certificate imports for easy switching
* Configurable signing options
* Meant to be used with Apple Accounts that are part of `ADP` (Apple Developer Program)
* No tracking, analytics, or data collection
